# VRCFT iPhone/iPad ARKit LiveLink Module
Updated Dazmbe's LiveLink module, compatible with VRCFaceTracking v5.0.0+

Note that the tracking will only realistically work *without a headset on your face*, so this is primary meant for use in VRChat's *desktop mode*.

## ‚ñ∂ Usage

Check the [VRCFT docs](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/hardware/iphone-arkit)

## üîç Troubleshooting

- Double check to make sure that your Apple device and computer are connected to the same network
- Double check the IP address entered in LiveLink match your computer's local IP address
- Check that the IP address entered is the local IP for the shared network, and not for any other networks your computer may be connected to (e.g. Hamachi, NordVPN)
- Ensure that your avatar supports VRCFT, and check in the toggles to make sure it is enabled
- Check your Windows network settings, and ensure that the network is set as a private network
